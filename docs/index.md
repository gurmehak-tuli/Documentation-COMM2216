# Introduction

This user guide will explain how to use DaVinci Resolve to edit videos. DaVinci Resolve is a powerful professional video editing program, and in this guide, we'll show you how to set up your project, import footage, edit your footage, and export your footage. Our goal is to explain the basic steps of editing video footage and introduce you to the basic features that DaVinci Resolve offers.

## Typographical Conventions

1.  When navigating menus in DaVinci Resolve, we'll use _italics_ to tell you what to click on. 
    For example, here's how we would tell you to save your project in DaVinci Resolve:
    
    _File -> Save Project_

2. We'll use **bold text** to show hotkeys in case you prefer using hotkeys instead of menus. For example, you can press Cntrl and S at the same time to save your project. Here's how we would tell you to save your project using a hotkey:

    **Ctrl + S**

    Please know that hotkeys are completely optional.

3.  When interacting with DaVinci Resolve's graphial user interface (GUI), we might give you a helpful GIF that shows you what to do. For example, here is a GIF that shows you how to add imported footage to your timeline so you can begin editing the footage.

    ![Add a video to your timeline](ADD_VIDEO_TO_TIMELINE.gif){: style="width:300px; height:200px"}

4.  We'll use special info blocks to give you extra information, inform you when a task is done, or warn you before you make an irreversible action. Here's what each of those info blocks look like.

    !!! info
        This block will give you helpful information.

    !!! success
        This block will tell you that you've completed a step.

    !!! warning
        This block will warn you about committing an irreversible action.

## Warnings

1. DaVinci Resolve requires significant computing power to run, so we recommend closing all programs that you aren't currently using. This will help you avoid crashing.
2. Always remember to save your work before exiting DaVinci Resolve. You can do this by going to *File -> Save* or by pressing **Cntrl + S**.
3. This guide will not explain any tools in the **Fusion**, **Colour**, or **Audio pages**. If you need to use these pages, you'll need to find a different user guide.
